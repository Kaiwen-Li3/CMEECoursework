# Final CMEE Bootcamp Assessment: Kaiwen

- You had an .gitignore. You could have done with more exclusions specific to certain weeks (remember that you can include/exclude subdirectories/files/patterns). You may [find this useful](https://www.gitignore.io).

- You had an OK overall Readme which gave a sufficient overview of the Repo as a whole, and gave general details of things like languages used. You also had weekly Readme files which went into more details relevant to each week. You could have included versions of languages and dependencies/packages used. Also check out [this resource](https://github.com/jehna/readme-best-practices).

- `WeekFinal` was not expected...

## Week 1

  - README in the `Week1` folder was missing, which would have improved clarity and usability.
  - Example outputs or expected results were not documented in the README.
  - Bash scripts (`MyExampleScript.sh`) were functional but lacked robust error handling and meaningful comments.
  
## Week 2

  - README was expanded slightly to include library dependencies like `ipdb` and `csv`.
  - README for `Week2` was still missing.
  - Results folder contained output files like `oaks_debugme_results.csv`, which ideally should have been excluded.
  - Scripts like `basic_io1.py` and `basic_io3.py` failed due to missing input files.
  - Debugging tools (`ipdb`) were left in some scripts, which should have been removed for production.

## Week 3

  - README for `Week3` was missing.
  - The structure for managing datasets in `data` and results in `results` could be better documented.
  - Errors like uninitialized variables and missing dependencies were encountered in `functionswithconditionals.R` and `datavisualisation.R`.
  - Some scripts lacked inline comments, making it difficult to understand the logic.

## Week 4
  - README provided a summary of the Florida autocorrelation practical and groupwork tasks.
  - README could provide step-by-step instructions for reproducing the Florida practical, including handling potential issues.
  - Missing input files caused `TreeHeight.R` to fail, showing a lack of robust error handling.
  - The `Florida.R` script implemented the permutation test, but was barebones, and no data visualizations were attempted.
    - Add inline comments explaining the purpose of each step in the permutation analysis.
  - The report was missing
  - Your Groupwork practicals were all in order, and your group did well in collaborating on it based on the commit/merge/pull history. Check the groupwork feedback pushed to your group repo for more details.   
    - The Autocorrelation practical code was efficient, providing a correct answer to the question. The statistical and biological/ecological interpretations in the report could have been stronger; had a somewhat weak conclusion at the end.

## Git Practices

- Commit messages were detailed and task-specific in later weeks, showing improvement.
- `.gitignore` was updated to exclude most unnecessary files.
- Repository size grew to ~3.41 MiB, but no large binary files were committed - good.

### Suggestions
1. Use feature branches for major updates to segregate experimental code.
2. Include more descriptive commit messages, especially for significant changes.

## Overall Assessment

Overall, an acceptable job. 

You demonstrated progress in coding, project management, and analytical skills throughout the coursework, but keep going! Debugging and error handling needed more consistency across scripts.

May your scripts retained fatal errors which could nave been easily fixed - work on being more vigilant and persistent in chasing down errors the future.


It was a tough set of weeks, but I hope they have given you a good start towards further training, a quantitative masters dissertation, and ultimately a career in quantitative biology!
